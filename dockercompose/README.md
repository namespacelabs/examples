# From Docker Compose to Namespace

This directory contains the example that backs our [blog post](https://namespace.so/blog/from-docker-compose-to-namespace)
on how to move from Docker Compose to Namespace.
The working example is inspired by [Docker Compose - Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted).
